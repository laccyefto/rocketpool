## TrackPlug 5: The Ultimate Channel Strip Plug-in
  
TrackPlug 5 is a powerful channel strip plug-in that combines a 10-band EQ, a gate, a compressor, a de-esser and a brickwall filter in one interface. You can use TrackPlug 5 to shape the tone, dynamics and noise of any audio track, whether it's vocals, guitars, drums or synths. TrackPlug 5 offers over 60 presets to get you started, and allows you to customize every parameter to suit your needs.
  
## MasterVerb 5: Silky Smooth Multi-Algorithm Reverb
  
MasterVerb 5 is a versatile reverb plug-in that lets you create realistic or creative spaces for your sounds. MasterVerb 5 features six different reverb algorithms: Hall, Room, Plate, Chamber, Ambience and Inverse. You can adjust the size, decay, damping, diffusion and pre-delay of each algorithm, as well as the early reflections and reverb tail separately. MasterVerb 5 also includes a 3-band EQ and a stereo width control to fine-tune the reverb sound.
  
## FinalPlug 5: Professional Peak Limiter and Volume Maximizer
  
FinalPlug 5 is a peak limiter and volume maximizer plug-in that can help you achieve loudness and clarity in your mixes and masters. FinalPlug 5 uses a sophisticated lookahead algorithm that prevents distortion and preserves transients. You can control the threshold, ceiling, release and dithering of the limiter, as well as the input and output levels. FinalPlug 5 also features a histogram display that shows the input and output levels over time.
  
## MultiDynamics 5: Powerful Multi-Band Dynamics Control
  
MultiDynamics 5 is a multi-band dynamics processor that can compress, expand, gate or limit up to six frequency bands independently. You can use MultiDynamics 5 to balance the levels of different frequency ranges in your audio, or to apply creative effects such as de-essing, de-humming, de-popping or multiband distortion. MultiDynamics 5 offers a flexible crossover system that lets you adjust the number and slope of the bands, as well as a graphical display that shows the input and output levels of each band.
  
## Panorama 5: Go Beyond the Limitations of Conventional Stereo
  
Panorama 5 is a unique spatial processor that can create realistic or immersive sound fields using only two speakers or headphones. Panorama 5 uses psychoacoustic principles to simulate the way we perceive sound in real life, such as distance cues, head-related transfer functions (HRTF), early reflections and reverberation. You can use Panorama 5 to position any sound source in a virtual space with precise control over azimuth, elevation, distance and size.
