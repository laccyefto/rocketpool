However, Navicat Premium 11 is not a free software. You need to purchase a license to use it for commercial purposes. If you don't have a license, you may be tempted to use a keygen to generate a serial number and activate your software. A keygen is a program that creates unique codes that can bypass the software's security system[^3^]. But is it safe and legal to use a keygen?
 
## The Risks of Using a Keygen
 
Using a keygen may seem like a convenient and cheap way to get access to Navicat Premium 11, but it comes with many risks. Here are some of the dangers of using a keygen:
 
- **It is illegal.** Using a keygen is a form of software piracy, which is a violation of intellectual property rights. You are stealing from the developers who spent time and money to create the software. You may face legal consequences if you are caught using a pirated software.
- **It is unethical.** Using a keygen is unfair to the developers who deserve to be compensated for their work. You are also depriving yourself of the benefits of using a legitimate software, such as technical support, updates, bug fixes, and security patches.
- **It is unsafe.** Using a keygen may expose your computer to malware, viruses, spyware, or ransomware. A keygen may contain malicious code that can harm your system or steal your personal information. You may also download fake or corrupted files that can damage your software or data.

## The Benefits of Using a Legitimate Software
 
Instead of using a keygen, you should consider buying a license for Navicat Premium 11 from the official website[^2^]. Here are some of the benefits of using a legitimate software:

- **It is legal.** You will have peace of mind knowing that you are using the software in accordance with the law and the terms of service. You will also support the developers who created the software and encourage them to improve their products.
- **It is ethical.** You will respect the rights and efforts of the developers who deserve to be paid for their work. You will also enjoy the full features and functions of the software without any limitations or restrictions.
- **It is safe.** You will protect your computer from malware, viruses, spyware, or ransomware. You will also receive regular updates, bug fixes, security patches, and technical support from the developers. You will also have access to cloud databases like Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas[^2^].

## Conclusion
 
Navicat Premium 11 is a great database development tool that can help you work with multiple databases from a single application. However, using a keygen to activate your software is not a good idea. It is illegal, unethical, and unsafe. You should buy a license from the official website instead and enjoy the benefits of using a legitimate software.
